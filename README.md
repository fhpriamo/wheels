Modeling the mechanics of an interesting problem as an OOP design exercise.

The rationale behind the design is based on a question statement originally published in 2016 on the largest entrance exam in Brazil, known as ***ENEM***.

The statement of the question, originally in portuguese, is loosely translated to english on the text below:

_The devise and coupling between gears revolutionazed the science at the time and made possible the invention of several technologies, like the clock. When building a small chronometer, a watchmaker uses the gear system shown. According to the figure, a motor is connected to the shaft making the arrow spin. The motor frequency is 18 RPM, and the number of cogs of the gears is shown on the chart._
